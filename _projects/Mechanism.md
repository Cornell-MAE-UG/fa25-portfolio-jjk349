For my Statics and Mechanics of materials class, we were required to design a mechanism that would maximize the height and weight that could be lifted using a single linear actuator. My design consists of a single straight bar pinned at the corner of the allowed design space, with the actuator pinned to the ground, with the push arm pinned to the middle of the bar. This gives a good balance between height and weight that the actuator can lift using the bar as a lever arm.

This is the design I created:
