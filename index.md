## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am an aspiring Mechanical Engineer at Cornell University. I was born and raised in New York City, but currently live in Long Island. My work on Cornell FSAE Racing has taught me lots of hands-on engineering skills, while I learn theory in my classes.

Take a look at <a href="{{ "/projects/" | relative_url }}">my projects</a> and <a href="{{ "/cv/" | relative_url }}">CV</a>.
